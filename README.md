# lille-0919-js-projet2-zeldaSnes

Here is the second project of the Wild Code School, we were 6 working on it.

We chose here to create a game inspired by The legend of Zelda : Link to the Past on snes using ReactJs. This project has been doned in 4 weeks using agile method and a fake customer in order to mimic a real pro experience.

The game is playable with a controller on Mozilla firefox.
